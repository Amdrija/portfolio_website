          <p>Hi, I'm Andrija Jelenkovic, an electrical engineering student at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Department of Signals and Systems.</p>
          <p>I know a lot of things. Some of those skills are useful, like Web Development, and others, like gaming, not so much.</p>
          <p>I enjoy solving problems a lot and this website was built as a solution to one of the problems I had: "How to advertize my skills to future employers/clients?"</p>
          <p>In the meantime, I continue to mess around with new projects and I try to learn new technologies.</p>
